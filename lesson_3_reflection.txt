When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

-- e.g. working on an open source project

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

-- It could potentially produce interferences with local work if working on the same project with multiple contributors who are actively updating the remote repo.
